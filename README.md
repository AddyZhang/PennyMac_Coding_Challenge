# PennyMac_Coding_Challenge

The two problems are all looking for minimum difference between two columns. 

I approached the answer with using pandas package and without using pandas.

# General Approach
1. open file and iterate line
2. get difference and compare with the minimum difference. If it is less than minimum difference, store the name and value
